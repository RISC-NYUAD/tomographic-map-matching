* Tomographic Map Matching

This repository hosts the code used to perform the studies in our paper titled [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19461][Efficient and Distributed Large-Scale 3D Map Registration using Tomographic Features]].

* Installation

The algorithms have been implemented to run within [[https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer][Apptainer]] (formerly Singularity) containers for portability and execution on various platforms, including HPC clusters. Tested on Singularity CE 3.8.1, 4.1.2 and Apptainer 1.3.3.

1. Follow the [[https://apptainer.org/docs/admin/main/installation.html][installation steps]] from Apptainer website to install the latest version.

2. Clone the repository recursively & download additional files

#+begin_src shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RISC-NYUAD/tomographic-map-matching
cd tomographic-map-matching
make init
#+end_src

* Running an algorithm on data

Some example data configurations are provided for the data used in the experiment. Other configurations can be generated using scripts in ~utils~.

To build the container for a particular algorithm, use ~make {name}~, with container names:
- ~roitr~ for RoITr
- ~geotr~ for GeoTransformer
- ~dgr~ for DeepGlobalRegistration
- ~buffer~ for BUFFER
- ~consensus~ for the proposed method
- ~all~ for all of the above (takes a long time)

Once the container is built, the algorithm can be run by invoking  ~launch_image.sh~ script with the folder name:

#+begin_src shell
./launch_image.sh {Consensus,BUFFER,RoITr,DeepGlobalRegistration,GeoTransformer}
#+end_src

A simple demo pair can be run using

#+begin_src shell
./launch_image.sh Consensus --data_config /data/config/demo/demo.json --parameter_config /workspace/config/consensus-interiornet.json
#+end_src

If you would like to see the visuals, allow xhost access by running ~xhost +local:~ and appending ~--visualize~ flag to the above sample:

#+begin_src shell
./launch_image.sh Consensus --data_config /data/config/demo/demo.json --parameter_config /workspace/config/consensus-interiornet.json --visualize
#+end_src
